✅ Task: Redesign my website layout to follow 2025 best practices that maximize traffic, readability, and conversions.

🎯 Requirements:
- Use a clean, modern aesthetic.
- Mobile-first design, fully responsive.
- High readability: body text 18–20px, large headings, clear hierarchy.
- SEO-friendly, fast-loading, minimal JavaScript.
- Accessibility standards: high contrast, semantic HTML, alt text placeholders.

💡 Content Style:
- Hero section with large headline, subheadline, and primary CTA.
- Below the hero: either
    → A magazine-style 2–3 column grid for blog/articles
    → OR a single-column centered layout for longform reading
  (choose depending on the `sitePurpose` variable)
- Sticky navbar with logo + links, and sticky footer with socials, copyright, and newsletter signup.

✨ Visuals:
- Neutral or soft background colors.
- Support dark/light theme toggle.
- Subtle animations for hover states and scrolling (but keep it fast and usable).
- Use web-safe modern fonts: Inter, Manrope, or system UI.

🔗 Tech Stack:
- TailwindCSS for styling.
- Semantic HTML5.
- Use Next.js pages/layout conventions.
- Optimize images with `next/image`.

✍️ Variable:
- `sitePurpose` = [“content-heavy blog”, “longform essays”, “landing page for product/service”] — adjust layout accordingly.

👉 Deliverable:
A clean, complete Next.js page file (with Tailwind) implementing the above layout, structured, commented, and ready to plug in. Include placeholder text & dummy links where applicable.

🌟 Goal: Make this design feel like it belongs in 2025 but respects timeless principle
